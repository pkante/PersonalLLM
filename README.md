# Personal LLM

Inspired by this: https://x.com/JonhernandezIA/status/1969054219647803765

A personalized AI assistant that remembers what you share. The idea is simple: you upload files, jot down notes, or keep chatting, and the assistant keeps that context ready for the next time you show up. The frontend is a little workspace with a "Memories" panel on the left and an AI chat on the right

next steps: 
auth, file ingestion, vector search, and real chat streaming
